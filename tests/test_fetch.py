<p>This is the body of the test article. It contains enough text to
pass the 200-character minimum threshold required by the extractor.
We need to make sure this paragraph is long enough so trafilatura
and the BS4 fallback both consider it meaningful content.</p>
<p>Here is some additional text to pad out the length even further.
Traffic comes from many sources and the extractor needs enough
content to be confident it has found the real article body and not
some sidebar or footer text. This should be more than enough.</p>

<p>This is a comment-like block of text that trafilatura may skip

The text is long enough to be considered content but the structure
is too loose for trafilatura to extract confidently.</p>
<p>More text here to ensure we cross the 200-character boundary so
the BeautifulSoup fallback can pick it up when trafilatura gives up.
This simulates poorly-structured pages that still contain readable
content that we want to extract.</p>
